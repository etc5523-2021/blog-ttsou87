Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for other countries, especially those developing countries without the technology or resource to develop their own vaccines. Nigeria, being a country under the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), is one of the countries that requires external support. In this blog post, I will be looking into the coronavirus situation in Nigeria using data from Our World in Data.\nData Description\nTwo data sets are used in this short overview of COVID-19 situation in Nigeria, one on COVID-19 cases and one regarding the vaccination progress in Nigeria Hannah Ritchie and Roser (2020).\nCOVID-19 Confirmed cases and Death\nDue to the conditions in Nigeria, many of the more detailed variables such as icu patients, weekly_icu_admissions..etc. are missing from the data set. As COVID-19 related data is aggregated for countries all around the world, more developed countries with better recording resources will have more data. Nigeria, on the other hand, lacks record hence it has 45 less columns of data in comparison. For the purpose of my analysis, I cleaned up the data to remove the columns with completely no data, and used the remaining columns to illustrate the conditions of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nFollowing is the data description table for the cases data set:\n\n\n\nTable 1: Data Description table for COVID-19 Confirmed cases and Death\n\n\nVariables\n\n\nDescription\n\n\ndate\n\n\nDate of Record\n\n\ntotal_cases\n\n\nTotal confirmed cases of COVID-19\n\n\nnew_cases\n\n\nNew confirmed cases of COVID-19\n\n\nnew_cases_smoothed\n\n\nNew confirmed cases of COVID-19 (7-day smoothed)\n\n\ntotal_deaths\n\n\nTotal deaths attributed to COVID-19\n\n\nnew_deaths\n\n\nNew deaths attributed to COVID-19\n\n\nnew_deaths_smoothed\n\n\nNew deaths attributed to COVID-19 (7-day smoothed)\n\n\ntotal_cases_per_million\n\n\nTotal confirmed cases of COVID-19 per 1,000,000 people\n\n\nnew_cases_per_million\n\n\nNew confirmed cases of COVID-19 per 1,000,000 people\n\n\nnew_cases_smoothed_per_million\n\n\nNew confirmed cases of COVID-19 (7-day smoothed) per 1,000,000 people\n\n\ntotal_deaths_per_million\n\n\nTotal deaths attributed to COVID-19 per 1,000,000 people\n\n\nnew_deaths_per_million\n\n\nNew deaths attributed to COVID-19 per 1,000,000 people\n\n\nnew_deaths_smoothed_per_million\n\n\nNew deaths attributed to COVID-19 (7-day smoothed) per 1,000,000 people\n\n\nreproduction_rate\n\n\nReal-time estimate of the effective reproduction rate (R) of COVID-19\n\n\n\nVaccine Source and Vaccination Rate\nOur World in Data’s vaccination data is a compilation of vaccination data that are verifiable based on public official sources. The vaccination data is separated into two smaller data set, one containing the source of the vaccines and the other the vaccinated population count.\nVaccine Source\nThe following table contains the data descriptions for the vaccine source:\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Data Description table for vaccine source\n\n\nVariables\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nPipeline\n\n\nThe vaccine pipeline through which the vaccine was delivered. Either COVAX or Other.\n\n\nVaccine\n\n\nThe common name of the vaccine delivered\n\n\nFunder\n\n\nThe name of the funder that funded the procurement of the vaccine. ‘Procured’ is used where a country purchased the vaccines using their own funds.\n\n\nDoses\n\n\nThe number of doses delivered\n\n\nSource.Url\n\n\nThe URL of the source article where information about the delivery was published\n\n\nNewPipeline\n\n\nCombination of pipeline and Funder\n\n\nDate\n\n\nThe date when the vaccine delivery was reported\n\n\nVaccine Administered\nThe following table contains the data descriptions for the vaccination progress:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Data Description table for the vaccination progress\n\n\nVariables\n\n\nDescription\n\n\ndate\n\n\nDate of the observation\n\n\ntotal_vaccinations\n\n\nTotal number of doses administered. For vaccines that require multiple doses, each individual dose is counted. If a person receives one dose of the vaccine, this metric goes up by 1. If they receive a second dose, it goes up by 1 again. If they receive a third/booster dose, it goes up by 1 again.\n\n\npeople_vaccinated\n\n\ntotal number of people who received at least one vaccine dose. If a person receives the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine, this metric goes up by 1. If they receive the second dose, the metric stays the same.\n\n\npeople_fully_vaccinated\n\n\nTotal number of people who received all doses prescribed by the vaccination protocol. If a person receives the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine, this metric stays the same. If they receive the second dose, the metric goes up by 1.\n\n\ndaily_vaccinations_raw\n\n\nDaily change in the total number of doses administered. It is only calculated for consecutive days.\n\n\ndaily_vaccinations\n\n\nNew doses administered per day (7-day smoothed). For countries that don’t report data on a daily basis, we assume that doses changed equally on a daily basis over any periods in which no data was reported. This produces a complete series of daily figures, which is then averaged over a rolling 7-day window.\n\n\ntotal_vaccinations_per_hundred\n\n\ntotal_vaccinations per 100 people in the total population of the country.\n\n\npeople_vaccinated_per_hundred\n\n\npeople_vaccinated per 100 people in the total population of the country.\n\n\npeople_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred\n\n\npeople_fully_vaccinated per 100 people in the total population of the country.\n\n\ndaily_vaccinations_per_million\n\n\ndaily_vaccinations per 1,000,000 people in the total population of the country.\n\n\n\nData Exploration\nCases and Deaths\nThe table below is an interactive table that explores the confirmed cases and COVID-19 related deaths in Nigeria since the first outbreak in February of 2020.\nIt is important to note that because there were only two dates recorded for cases in February 2020, the monthly cases plot is unreliable. The mean reproduction rate of the virus was calculated for each month by taking the average. Days were the reproduction rate was not recorded are not included in the computation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"top\",\"filterHTML\":\"<tr>\\n  <td><\\/td>\\n  <td data-type=\\\"character\\\"

1: Confrimed Cases and Deaths from 2020-2021\n\n\n\nTable 1 shows that a month with high number of new cases is followed by a month with high death. For example January 2021, where the highest number of new cases was recorded in a month, was followed by February, with the highest record of deaths in a month. A reason for the surge of second wave in January 2021 was explained in this Financial Times article.\n\n“What is driving it . . . is very clearly human behaviour,” he said, arguing that, after strong compliance with mitigation measures last year, “prevention fatigue” had set in, with people neglecting social distancing practices. Neil Munshi and Schipani (2021)\n\nSince then, measures has been taken to enhance regulations. “President Muhammadu Buhari signed the COVID-19 Health Protection Regulations into law in January 2021” Oghifo (2021).\nVaccines\nWith people getting tired of social distancing practices, the next best way to fight against the virus is vaccines. However, Nigeria is slow at vaccinating its people. This is largely due to the lack of access to the vaccines.\nThe following is a table of all the vaccines Nigeria has received\n\n\nPipeline\n\n\nVaccine\n\n\nFunder\n\n\nDoses\n\n\nCOVAX\n\n\n\n\nGlobal\n\n\n592880\n\n\nCOVAX\n\n\nAstraZeneca\n\n\nGlobal\n\n\n3924000\n\n\nOther\n\n\nAstraZeneca\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n100000\n\n\nOther\n\n\nAstraZeneca\n\n\nProcured\n\n\n300000\n\n\nCOVAX\n\n\nAstraZeneca\n\n\nUK\n\n\n699760\n\n\nOther\n\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\n\nAfrican Union\n\n\n177600\n\n\nCOVAX\n\n\nModerna\n\n\nUSA\n\n\n4000080\n\n\nAs shown in the table above, almost all of the vaccines Nigeria received has was from other countries. They only government bought vaccines were 300000 doses of Astra Zeneca. It is clear that Nigeria is in a passive position when it comes to vaccination.\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"data\":[{\"x\":[18690,18691,18692,18693,18694,18695,18696,18697,18698,18699,18700,18701,18702,18703,18704,18705,18706,18707,18708,18709,18710,18711,18712,18713,18714,18715,18716,18717,18718,18719,18720,18721,18722,18723,18724,18725,18726,18727,18728,18729,18730,18731,18732,18733,18734,18735,18736,18737,18738,18739,18740,18741,18742,18743,18744,18745,18746,18747,18748,18749,18750,18751,18752,18753,18754,18755,18756,18757,18758,18759,18760,18761,18762,18763,18764,18765,18766,18767,18768,18769,18770,18771,18772,18773,18774,18775,18776,18777,18778,18779,18780,18781,18782,18783,18784,18785,18786,18787,18788,18789,18790,18791,18792,18793,18794,18795,18796,18797,18798,18799,18800,18801,18802,18803,18804,18805,18806,18807,18808,18809,18810,18811,18812,18813,18814,18815,18816,18817,18818,18819,18820,18821,18822,18823,18824,18825,18826,18827,18828,18829,18830,18831,18832,18833,18834,18835,18836,18837,18838,18839,18840,18841,18842,18843,18844,18845,18846,18847,18848,18849,18850,18851,18852,18853,18854,18855,18856,18857,18858,18859,18860,18861,18862,18863,18864,18865,18866,18867,18868,18869,18870],\"y\":[null,727,727,727,727,727,727,727,727,727,727,727,4900,9074,13247,17420,21593,25767,29940,29940,29940,34097,38255,42412,46570,52044,57519,62993,68909,64632,60356,56079,50485,44891,36556,23623,20882,18141,15400,12660,9919,9919,9553,12486,12154,11821,11132,11513,12798,13867,11005,11243,10684,10494,9648,8320,7654,7621,7753,8317,8790,9272,10740,12575,57694,61598,62281,65775,66637,68786,67683,21672,20180,20871,17979,18447,18935,18749,20538,18941,16777,15913,13900,10440,10377,10427,9968,12193,13654,15927,22324,28645,34503,38321,41425,44843,47448,44660,42029,39399,39399,39399,39399,39399,40844,42290,43735,45180,46626,48071,49517,49517,49517,52895,56274,59653,63031,64835,66638,68442,66867,65291,63716,62141,55437,48733,42029,35325,28620,21916,15212,13182,11152,9122,7092,5062,3032,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,1002,2480,3957,5434,6911,8388,9865,11342,11342,11342,11342,11342,11342,11342,11342,11342,11342,11342,11342,11342,21616,31889,42162],\"text\":[\"date:
